	<h1>About me</h1>
	 
	<p>My family comes from Latvia and Belarus.</p> 
  
	<p>I am also interested in the phonetics and phonology of stress and prosodic prominence. I have worked on the properties of stress in Georgian, Udmurt (Uralic), and the Malyja Aŭciuki (Малыя Аўцюкі) dialect of Belarusian (Slavic).</p>
