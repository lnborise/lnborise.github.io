	<h1>About me</h1>
	 
	<p>My family comes from Latvia and Belarus.</p> 
  
	<p>I pronounce my first name as [ˈlɛna], but respond to many other variants too: [ˈleːna], [ˈlʲeːna], and [ˈleɪna] are all fine </p>
	
	<p>My last name requires more of an introduction. It goes back to a Belarusian last name Барыс/Barys [baˈrɨs] (like the first name), which was adopted into Russian with a shifted stress, Борис/Boris [ˈbɔrɪs], and then into Latvian with a feminine ending -e. In its today's form, it's pronounced [ˈbɔrɪsɛ] (often rendered as  [ˈbɔrɪseɪ] in English).</p>
