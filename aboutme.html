	<h1>About me</h1>
	 
	<p>My family comes from Latvia and Belarus.</p> 
  
	<p>I pronounce my first name as [ˈlɛna], but respond to many other variants too: [ˈleːna], [ˈlʲeːna], and [ˈleɪna] are all fine. </p>
	
	<p>My last name needs more of an introduction. It goes back to a Belarusian last name <i>Барыс/Barys</i> [baˈrɨs] (like the first name), which was adopted into Russian with a retracted stress, <i>Борис/Boris</i> [ˈbɔrɪs], and then into Latvian with a feminine ending <i>-e</i>. In its today's form, it's pronounced [ˈbɔrɪsɛ].</p>
	
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, knitting, playing badminton, and spending time with my family and our doggie, Jack.</p>
