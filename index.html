	<h1>Lena Borise</h1>
	<p>I am currently a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.nytud.hu/eng/index.html">Hungarian Research Centre for Linguistics</a>. Before this, in 2019, I got a PhD in Linguistics from the <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Linguistics at Harvard</a>. My research lies at the intersection of syntax and phonology, with particular focus on understudied languages.
