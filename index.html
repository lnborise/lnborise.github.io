	  <p>I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSCA) Fellow at <a href="http://www.hittlinguistics.eus/en/">HiTT, the Basque Research Group of Theoretical Linguistics</a> at the University of the Basque Country (EHU/UPV).   
	  
	  <p>Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://nytud.hu/en">Hungarian Research Centre for Linguistics</a>. In 2019, I got a PhD in Linguistics from the <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Linguistics at Harvard University</a>. </p>
	  
	<p>My research lies at the intersection of syntax and phonology, with focus on understudied languages. I am particularly interested in how prosody interacts with clause structure, and how information structure is reflected in syntax and prosody. I have investigated these topics in Georgian (Kartvelian), Iron Ossetic (Iranian), Udmurt and Khanty (Uralic), and am currently exploring them in Basque.</p>
	  
	<p>I am also interested in the phonetics and phonology of stress and prosodic prominence, and have worked on these topics in Georgian, Iron Ossetic, Udmurt (Uralic), and the Malyja Aŭciuki dialect of Belarusian (Slavic).</p>
