	<h1>Lena Borise</h1>
	 
	<p>I am a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.nytud.hu/eng/index.html">Hungarian Research Centre for Linguistics</a>. Before this, in 2019, I got a PhD in Linguistics from the <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Linguistics at Harvard</a>. My research lies at the intersection of syntax and phonology, with focus on understudied languages.</p>
	<p>I am particularly interested in how prosody interacts with clause structure, and how information structure is reflected in syntax and prosody. In my dissertation, I investigated these topics in Georgian, a Kartvelian language spoken in the Caucasus.</p>
	<p>I am also interested in the phonetics and phonology of stress and prosodic prominence. I have worked on the properties of stress in Georgian, Udmurt (Uralic), and the Malyja Aŭciuki (Малыя Аўцюкі) dialect of Belarusian (Slavic).</p>
