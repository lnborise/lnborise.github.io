	  <p>I am a Chargée de Recherches (Research Scientist) at CNRS, affiliated with the <a href="http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/en">Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle</a> at the Université Paris Cité. </p>		  
	  
	  <p>Previously, I was a  Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at <a href="http://www.hittlinguistics.eus/en/">HiTT, the Basque Research Group of Theoretical Linguistics</a> at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://nytud.hu/en">Hungarian Research Centre for Linguistics</a>. I got my PhD from the <a href="https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of Linguistics at Harvard University</a> in 2019. </p>
	  
	<p>My research lies at the intersection of syntax and phonology, with focus on understudied languages. I am particularly interested in how prosody interacts with clause structure, and how information structure is reflected in syntax and prosody. Recently, I have also been studying the behavior of postverbal constituents in verb-final languages. I have investigated these topics in Georgian (Kartvelian), Iron Ossetic (Iranian), Udmurt and Khanty (Uralic), as well as Basque.</p>
	  
	<p>I am also interested in the phonetics and phonology of stress and prosodic prominence, and have worked on these topics in Georgian, Iron Ossetic, Udmurt, and the Malyja Aŭciuki dialect of Belarusian.</p>
